### Why ESM Startup Time is Faster:
- **Asynchronous Loading**: ES Modules load dependencies asynchronously, which avoids blocking the rest of the application during startup. This leads to better performance, especially in environments like browsers or Node.js where multiple tasks can be handled in parallel.

- **Parallel Loading**: ES Modules can load multiple dependencies in parallel, unlike CommonJS, which resolves them one-by-one, sequentially, causing a bottleneck.

- **Static Analysis**: ES Modules are statically analyzed upfront, meaning the loader can efficiently fetch and resolve dependencies all at once, instead of discovering and loading them dynamically during execution as in CommonJS.

- **Lazy Loading**: ES Modules support dynamic imports (import()), allowing for lazy loading of modules at runtime, reducing the need to load everything upfront.

- **Optimized for the Web**: In browser environments, ES Modules benefit from parallel network requests and non-blocking I/O operations, leading to faster load times compared to the bundling and synchronous execution required by CommonJS.

### ESM utilizes more threads

ES Modules (ESM) take advantage of parallel loading by allowing the JavaScript engine (whether in the browser or Node.js) to use multiple threads for fetching and loading dependencies asynchronously. This is a key difference compared to CommonJS (CJS), where even if additional threads are available, they won't be utilized because CommonJS uses a synchronous, single-threaded loading process.
