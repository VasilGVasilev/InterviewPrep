### Throttling and Debouncing (one in an interval, once every interval)

Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval. In the debouncing technique, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only after the specified time once the user stops firing the event. Thus, throttling executes the function at a regular interval, while debouncing executes the function only after some cooling period.
