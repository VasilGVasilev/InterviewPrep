By using alignSelf, you can control the alignment of individual child elements independently of the parent container's alignItems property. This is useful when you need specific alignment for certain elements within a flex container.

**it is also an alternative to the setting width**

Using alignSelf can be an alternative to setting the width of a container in certain scenarios where you want the container to adjust its size based on its content and alignment within its parent. Instead of explicitly setting a fixed or percentage-based width, alignSelf allows the container to dynamically adjust its size based on the alignment properties and the content it holds.
