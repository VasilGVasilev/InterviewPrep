AJAX is a revolutionary technique introduced in the late 90s early 00s, making SPAs possible. Have an app make a request to update a certain part of the page without fully reloading the page. 



Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, or Ajax, is not a technology in itself, but rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object. When these technologies are combined in the Ajax model, web applications are able to make quick, incremental updates to the user interface **without reloading the entire browser page**.
