In the case of handler functions, we may have variables with const that seemingly change their value provided the change is once for each function call:

```js
    const handleInputFocus = () => {
        const adjustedPageY = scrollPosition + 250; 
        scrollViewRef.current?.scrollTo({ y: adjustedPageY, animated: true });
    };
```

Since *handleInputFocus* is a handler function the adjustedPageY does change, but it changes with each new call of the function. Meaning we have (an instance) a new function reference to the handler function with its own values. Thus, const is read only but appears to be changing values, although it is not, rather we create new references. 

If this function is defined within a component or another function that is called multiple times, a new function reference for handleInputFocus will be created each time the parent component or function re-renders or is called. This new reference is indeed subject to garbage collection once it's no longer in use, assuming there are no lingering references to it from closures or other retained scopes.

**Mind** that instance rethoric is semantically a bit false. The "new instance" concept is tied to class-based object instantiation, involving creating objects with their own state and behavior. A "new function reference" in JavaScript refers to the creation of a new function object in memory, which can happen even without classes, simply by defining a function within another function or a dynamic context. Both involve allocating new objects in memory, but the context and implications (especially regarding inheritance, methods, and properties in OOP vs. closures and scopes in JavaScript functions) differ significantly.
