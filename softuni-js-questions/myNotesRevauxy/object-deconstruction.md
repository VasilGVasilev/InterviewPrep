When you use object destructuring to merge two objects in JavaScript, if there are keys that exist in both objects, the values from the second object will overwrite the values from the first object for those keys. This is because the spread operator (`...`) copies properties from one object to another, and if a property with the same key already exists, it will be overwritten.

### Example

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
const prev = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const dbData = { b: 20, c: 30, d: 40 };

const formDataProperty = { data: { ...prev, ...dbData } };

console.log(formDataProperty.data);
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Objects**:
    - prev has keys `a`, `b`, and `c` with values `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively.

    - dbData has keys `b`, `c`, and `d` with values `20`, `30`, and `40` respectively.

2. **Merging Objects**:
    - When merging -prev- and -dbData- using the spread operator, the keys from -dbData- will overwrite the keys from -prev- if they are the same.
    - The resulting object will have the following keys and values:
        - `a` from -prev- with value `1` (since -dbData- does not have `a`).
        - `b` from -dbData- with value `20` (overwriting `b` from -prev-).
        - `c` from -dbData- with value `30` (overwriting `c` from -prev-).
        - `d` from -dbData- with value `40` (since -prev- does not have `d`).

### Result

The resulting formDataProperty.data will be:

```javascript
{
    a: 1,
    b: 20,
    c: 30,
    d: 40
}
```

### Summary

When using object destructuring to merge objects, if there are keys that exist in both objects, the values from the second object will overwrite the values from the first object for those keys. This behavior ensures that the most recent values (from the second object) are used in the resulting merged object.
