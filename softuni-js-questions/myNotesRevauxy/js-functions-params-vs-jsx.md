In React JSX, when you pass props to a component, the order in which you specify the props does not matter because props are passed and accessed as properties of an object. This object is the `props` object within the component. Each prop is a key-value pair within this object, where the key is the prop name, and the value is the prop value. This is fundamentally different from function arguments in JavaScript, where order matters.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Passing Props**: When you use a component and pass props to it, you're essentially constructing an object. For example:

    ```jsx
    <MyComponent propA="valueA" propB="valueB" />
    ```

    Behind the scenes, React constructs an object like this:

    ```javascript
    { propA: "valueA", propB: "valueB" }
    ```

2. **Accessing Props**: Inside `MyComponent`, React makes this object available as the `props` parameter of the component function (or `this.props` in class components). You access the props using their names:

    ```jsx
    function MyComponent(props) {
      return <div>{props.propA} - {props.propB}</div>;
    }
    ```

    Because props are accessed by name, their order in the JSX tag does not matter. You could swap `propA` and `propB` around, and it would not affect how they are accessed within the component.

2.1 **What if I omit to pass a value to a Component that has a prop**

  **Native Component** like TextInput, if there is no conditional or default label value and label is a native TextInput tag, the label will be of value undefined:
  ```js
  function MyTextInput({ label, ...props }) {
    return (
      <View>
        {label && <Text>{label}</Text>}
        <TextInput {...props} />
      </View>
    );
  }
  ```
  **Custom components** have the same logic:
  ```js
  <MyComponent />


  function MyComponent(props) {
    console.log(props.myProp); // This will log `undefined` if `myProp` is omitted.
    return <div>{props.myProp ? 'myProp is true' : 'myProp is false'}</div>;
  }
  ```


3. **Named Parameters**: This behavior is akin to named parameters in some programming languages, where parameters of a function are identified by names rather than their position in the parameter list.

In summary, in React JSX, the precedence of prop names over their order allows for more readable and maintainable code, as you don't need to remember the order of parameters like you do with positional arguments in functions. This design also makes it easy to omit props or provide them with default values within the component.

4. **Functions**

```js
function exampleFunction(param1, param2) {
  console.log('param1:', param1);
  console.log('param2:', param2);
}

let param1 = 'first';
let param2 = 'second';

// Calling the function with the arguments reversed
exampleFunction(param2, param1);
```

even tho param1 and param2 already are used as parameter names in the function definition, the names of the variables outside the function do not influence how arguments are matched to parameters; **it's solely based on the order of the arguments in the function call.**
