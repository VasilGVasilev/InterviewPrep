Hash functions seem to be fundamental in Web3 and block chain tech. They work by encrypting an input to always output the same result. The hash key serves as proof of the input being untempered with. One hash function is sha256 and whether you use it online or via terminal, if you use that very plain sha256 function, it will always spit out the same hash key. This key you can later use to compare the file you receive via means that can be hacked an check the authencity of the file. 

Hash functions work by splitting the file into chuncks that as a whole then produce the final hash key. Encrypting input to output is easy, but dercypting a hash key into the original file is very a CPU cumbersome task called **brute search**.

## Bitcoin

Mining is exactly that - computers race to solve the hashes and earn mining reward, thus, also authenticating the whole blockchain ecosystem.
