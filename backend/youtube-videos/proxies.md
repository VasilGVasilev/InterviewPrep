Proxies are intermediaries between internet users and servers.

### Forward proxy 
Forward proxy is like the assistant for a user. It servers as a guard between the user and the actual open internet for security reasons, it forwards requests masking the actual user info. It also has caching if one user in a common local network has made a request for a file, thus, subsequent requests by other users are redirected to the cache for faster retriaval.

### Reverse proxy
Reverse proxy is like the waiter at a restaurant knowing the current load of tables. It mainly does load balancing but also security, caching, logging (for troubleshooting). Most popular reverse proxies - Nginx. Nginx is actually a web server and a reverse proxy ideal for serving static content.
