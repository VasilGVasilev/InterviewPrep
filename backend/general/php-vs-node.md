PHP Comparison to Node.js
    Event Loop: Node.js has a built-in event loop, while PHP requires libraries like ReactPHP or extensions like Swoole.
    Concurrency Model: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O, while PHP traditionally spawns multiple processes (blocking by default) but can achieve non-blocking behavior using tools.
    Ease of Use: Node.js is inherently asynchronous, while PHP needs extensions or additional libraries.

    In short, PHP can achieve non-blocking behavior, but it requires explicit use of libraries, extensions, or features designed for asynchronous programming.
