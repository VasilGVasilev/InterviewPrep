Why we need Paths? -> mainly for accessibility in CLIs.

You can view your system's PATH by using the `echo` command in the terminal. The PATH is stored in an environment variable, also called `PATH`. Here's the command:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

When you run this command, your terminal will print out the current PATH, which is a list of directories separated by colons (`:`). These directories are the places your system looks for executable files when you type a command.
