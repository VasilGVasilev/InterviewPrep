The following code is optimised by use of useCallback which memoizes (not in browser cache, but in special React Cache) the passed in function inbetween renders. Thus, on larger scale saving up resources not to re-render the handle function on each re-render of the component:

```sh

// Parent component
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = useCallback(() => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }, [count]
  ) 

  return (
    <div>
      <Child onIncrement={handleIncrement} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Child component
const Child = ({ onIncrement }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
  );
};



```

Notice the dependecny array of useCallback, it is crucial since it determines when to re-render the handle function. 

**Empty**

If it is empty, it renders the handlefunction only once. But then it will not reflect on the changes of state. This is typically used when you have a callback that doesn't depend on any external values and should remain constant throughout the component's lifecycle.

**Putting in a value**

This way, React knows that the callback depends on the count variable, and it will recreate the callback whenever count changes, ensuring that the correct value of count is used within the callback.


**why should I bother then with useCallback hook, since the same effect is to have no useCallback, but just a regular function, it re-renders every time state changes, thus, defeats the purpose of useCallback efficiency not to re-render inbetween render cycles?**


You bring up a valid point. The useCallback hook is primarily used to optimize performance in cases where a function reference needs to remain stable across renders, especially when that function is passed as a prop to child components. It's useful when you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders in child components that rely on the callback.

In situations where the function's reference does not need to be stable and you're okay with re-creating the function on each render, using a regular function declaration (without useCallback) is simpler and might be more appropriate. React is highly efficient at handling function re-creation, and in many cases, the performance difference is negligible.

Here are some guidelines for when to use useCallback:

**Stable Function References**: Use useCallback when you want to ensure that a function reference remains the same across renders. This is important **when passing functions as props to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders of those child components**.

Optimizing Expensive Calculations: If your callback involves expensive calculations that don't depend on any changing state or props, you can use useCallback to avoid re-calculating those values on each render.

Dependency Arrays: When using useCallback, be sure to specify the appropriate dependency array. If the function relies on some state or props, include those dependencies in the array to trigger the recreation of the function only when those dependencies change.

In cases where you don't have these specific needs and you're okay with function re-creation, using a regular function is perfectly fine and simplifies your code. React's performance optimizations, such as function memoization, ensure that unnecessary re-renders are avoided in most cases.

So, it's a matter of choosing the right tool for the job based on the specific requirements and performance considerations of your application.


**But if I don't put it, the state value will still be at the disposal of the handle function, so what exactly this ensuring consists of?**


You are correct that the state value will still be accessible within the handleFunction even if you don't include it in the dependency array of useCallback. However, the purpose of including dependencies in the dependency array is not just about whether the value is accessible or not, but it's about ensuring that your component behaves predictably and that React can optimize re-renders efficiently.

Here's why including dependencies in the array is important:

    Predictable Behavior: Including dependencies in the dependency array explicitly communicates to React that the callback function depends on those values. This helps other developers (including your future self) understand the purpose and behavior of the code more easily.

    Optimization: React uses the dependency array to determine when it should re-create the callback function. If a value is in the dependency array, React knows that it needs to re-create the function when that value changes. This optimization can prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance in some cases.

    Linter and Code Analysis: Some linting tools and code analysis tools may issue warnings or errors if you omit dependencies from the array, as it can lead to subtle bugs or unexpected behavior.

While omitting dependencies may work in some cases, it can also lead to subtle bugs and make your code less maintainable and understandable. Including dependencies explicitly in the array is a best practice that helps ensure that your code behaves as expected and benefits from React's performance optimizations.
