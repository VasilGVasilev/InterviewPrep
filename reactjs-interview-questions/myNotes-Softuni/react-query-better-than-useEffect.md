 In the context of React, useQuery and useEffect are both hooks that serve different purposes.
useEffect

useEffect is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually interacting with the DOM. useEffect takes a function as its first argument and executes it after the component has rendered. It also allows you to specify dependencies, which determine when the effect should be re-run.

Here is an example of regular fetch with axios

The code above requires both useState and useEffect hooks and uses three different states to store data and determine whether the application is fetching data or already has an error response from the API. This pattern is repeated over and over again for most of your application data fetching logic. if you need to get more understanding check this repo
useQuery 

useQuery is not a built-in hook in React. However, it is commonly associated with libraries like React Query or Apollo Client. useQuery is used for managing and fetching data from an API or backend. It provides a declarative and efficient way to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the UI components.

in this code, we arenâ€™t using the regular useState and useEffect hooks. This is because useQuery already has various values that we can use inside the application, such as isLoading, error response, and returned data. if you need to get more understanding check this repo


There is no longer any need to include your remote data in the global state thanks to React Query, a fantastic hook library for handling data queries. The library will manage caching, background updates, and stale data without any additional setup or code if you simply tell it where to get your data from.Additionally, React Query eliminates the requirement for useState and useEffect hooks and substitutes a few lines of React Query code in their stead. In the long term, it will unquestionably assist you in maintaining a quick, responsive, and maintained application. Although both useQuery and useEffect might include data gathering, their functions are distinct from one another. useQuery offers a higher-level abstraction for data management and is particularly made for maintaining and retrieving data through APIs.
