Javascript is high-level.

- this relates to the level of abstraction the language provides when dealing with the hardware of the computer. Machine code > Assembly (for each CPU/RAM) > C/C++ (need manual garabge collection) > Javascript/Python

Javascript is interpreted.

- this means code is translated line by line during runtime (execution). Compiled ones are translated as a whole before runtime (execution).
