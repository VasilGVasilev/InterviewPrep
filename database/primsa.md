Why do we need Prisma?

Well, what is Prisma - an ORM, object-relational mapping. What purpose does that server? Simply said, to add a layer of abstraction between us and low-level database query writing. One layer further would be a GUI, to make a more clear example. Also, Prisma to SQL or PostgreSQL is like Mongoose to MongoDB. Prisma is a database toolkit that supports various databases and provides an ORM and query builder, Mongoose is specifically designed for working with MongoDB databases and offers an ODM solution. **Basically, instead of writing DB queries manually in CLI, you use an ORM or ODM.**
