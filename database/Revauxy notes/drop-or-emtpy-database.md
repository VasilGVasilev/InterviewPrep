For your React Native app, whether to drop the table or just empty it after sending data to the server depends on the use case:

### Emptying the database (keeping the structure):

Use case: This is a good approach if the table structure (schema) is going to remain the same, and you anticipate needing the table again for storing new data.

Pros:
- You avoid the overhead of dropping and re-creating the table.
- It keeps the database structure intact, making it quicker to reuse.
- If the app continues to run, the database remains functional without needing to re-initialize it.

How: You can simply delete all the rows from the table (DELETE FROM your_table;).

### Dropping the table (and re-initializing):

Use case: This can be useful if you expect that the table structure might change in the future, or if re-initializing the table is part of a clean-up process for new sessions.

Pros:
- Ensures you get a fresh table every time, which can avoid issues like old schema versions persisting.
- Clears out any potential corrupt data from the previous session.

How: Drop the table using (DROP TABLE your_table;) and then re-create it as needed.
In most cases, emptying the table is more efficient unless you expect schema changes or issues that might require a full reset of the table.

### Mobile development

For mobile development it could be the case that there are devices that due to their mechanism of storing in DB or some update, it would be better to drop the db and init than to empty the db.
