# Creating an outline of a car in GIMP that can be used as an overlay requires several steps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve that:

Step 1: Open the Image
- Open GIMP.
- Go to File > Open and select the image of the car you want to outline.

Step 2: Select the Car
- Use the Free Select Tool (Lasso Tool):

Step 3: Create a Path from the Selection
- Once the car is selected, go to Select > To Path.
- This will convert your selection into a path.

Step 4: Stroke the Path
- Go to Select > None to deselect the current selection.
- Go to Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Paths to open the Paths dialog.
- In the Paths dialog, you should see a path named "Selection".
- Right-click on the "Selection" path and choose Path to Selection.
- Go to Edit > Stroke Path.
- In the Stroke Path dialog, choose the stroke line width and style that you prefer. Ensure "Stroke line" is selected, then click Stroke.

Step 5: Select the Stroke
- Ensure that the stroke is selected by using the Select by Color Tool (Shift + O).
- Click on the stroke to select it.

Step 6: Invert the Selection
- Go to Select > Invert (or press Ctrl + I).
- This will select everything except the stroke.

Step 7: Delete the Inverted Selection
- Press Delete on your keyboard.
- This will erase everything except the stroke, leaving only the stroke visible.

Step 8: Export the Image as PNG
- To ensure the image has a transparent background, go to Layer > Transparency > Add Alpha Channel
- Go to File > Export As.
