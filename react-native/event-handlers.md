### onPress vs onPRessIn

In React Native, both `onPress` and `onPressIn` are event handlers used with touchable components, but they are triggered at different points in the interaction:

1. **`onPress`**:
   - Triggered when the user taps and releases the component.
   - It is the most commonly used handler for handling tap gestures.
   - Example use case: Navigating to another screen or submitting a form.

2. **`onPressIn`**:
   - Triggered as soon as the user presses down on the component (before releasing).
   - It is useful for providing immediate feedback, such as changing the component's appearance when pressed.
   - Example use case: Highlighting a button or starting an animation when the user begins pressing.

### Key Difference:
- `onPress` waits for the user to complete the tap gesture (press and release).
- `onPressIn` is triggered immediately when the press starts.
