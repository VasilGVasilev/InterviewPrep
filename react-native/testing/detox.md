Detox is an end-to-end framework that is used on top of Jest - another testing framework. Why we need Jest. Jest doesn't provide a test runner, which is a tool that controls the execution of your tests and provides features like **setup/teardown, grouping tests into suites, and reporting results**. Jest comes into play here, it also supplies a **full asseriton library**.
