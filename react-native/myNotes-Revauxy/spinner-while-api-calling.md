# USE the `finally` because the finally Block Always Executes After the Async Operation

In your `MenuScreen.js` code, the `finally` block will always execute after the `dispatch(syncFiles())` call is complete because:

## 1. The `await` Keyword

```javascript
const startSyncFiles = async () => {
  try {
    setPendingStateSpinner(true);
    await dispatch(syncFiles());  // ← This await is crucial
  } finally {
    setPendingStateSpinner(false);
  }
};
```

The `await` keyword is the key mechanism ensuring the `finally` block runs only after the async operation completes (whether successfully or with an error):

- **It pauses execution** of the function until the Promise returned by `dispatch(syncFiles())` is settled
- **The function execution resumes** only after the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected
- **Only then** does execution continue to the `finally` block

## 2. JavaScript's Promise Resolution Rules

When you `await` a Promise:

1. If the Promise resolves successfully, execution continues with that result
2. If the Promise rejects (fails), an exception is thrown where the `await` appears
3. **In both cases**, the `finally` block will execute afterward

## 3. Redux Thunk Architecture

Your `syncFiles()` action creator likely returns a thunk function that:
- Handles the API call
- Dispatches success or failure actions
- Returns a Promise that resolves when the entire operation is complete

The `dispatch()` function, when given a thunk, returns the Promise that the thunk returns, allowing you to await its completion.

## Without the `await` Keyword

Without `await`, the `finally` block might run before the async operation completes:

```javascript
// Problematic code (DON'T DO THIS)
const startSyncFiles = async () => {
  try {
    setPendingStateSpinner(true);
    dispatch(syncFiles());  // No await! 
  } finally {
    setPendingStateSpinner(false);  // This runs immediately, not waiting for API call
  }
};
```

This would hide the spinner almost immediately instead of waiting for the sync operation to finish.

## The JavasScript Event Loop Ensures Proper Ordering

The JavaScript event loop and Promise processing mechanisms ensure that:

1. Your function is entered and `try` block starts
2. Loading state is set (`setPendingStateSpinner(true)`)
3. `dispatch(syncFiles())` is awaited - execution pauses
4. When the Promise settles (API complete), execution resumes
5. The `finally` block runs next, hiding the spinner
6. The function completes

This guarantees your UI correctly reflects the actual state of your asynchronous operations.
