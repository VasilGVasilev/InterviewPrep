```js
import { Camera, useCameraDevice } from 'react-native-vision-camera'
import { Gesture, GestureDetector } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

export function App() {
  const camera = useRef<Camera>(null)
  const device = useCameraDevice('back')

  const focus = useCallback((point: Point) => {
    const c = camera.current
    if (c == null) return
    c.focus(point)
  }, [])

  const gesture = Gesture.Tap()
    .onEnd(({ x, y }) => {
      runOnJS(focus)({ x, y })
    })

  if (device == null) return <NoCameraDeviceError />
  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gesture}>
      <Camera
        ref={camera}
        style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
        device={device}
        isActive={true}
      />
    </GestureDetector>
  )
}
```

In the provided code, the runOnJS function is used to ensure that the focus function is executed on the JavaScript thread. This is necessary because the gesture handling might be happening on a different thread (e.g., the UI thread) managed by the react-native-gesture-handler library.

Here's a breakdown of why you need to call runOnJS with focus and then have another () with { x, y }:

Explanation

1. runOnJS(focus):

This call wraps the focus function in a way that ensures it will be executed on the JavaScript thread.
runOnJS is a utility provided by react-native-reanimated to bridge between the native and JavaScript threads.

2. ({ x, y }):

This call invokes the wrapped focus function with the { x, y } coordinates.
The { x, y } are the coordinates of the tap gesture, which are passed to the focus function to focus the camera at that point.

### Detailed Breakdown
1. Gesture Handling:

    - The Gesture.Tap() creates a tap gesture recognizer.
    - The .onEnd method registers a callback function to be called when the tap gesture ends.
    - The callback function receives an event object containing the coordinates of the tap ({ x, y }).

2. Thread Management:

    - Gesture handling might be happening on a different thread (e.g., the UI thread).
    - To ensure that the focus function runs on the JavaScript thread, you use runOnJS.

3. Function Invocation:

    - runOnJS(focus) returns a new function that, when called, will execute focus on the JavaScript thread.
    - ({ x, y }) immediately invokes this new function with the tap coordinates.

**Using runOnJS is essential to ensure that your JavaScript functions are executed on the correct thread, The gesture handling might be happening on the UI thread, and calling a JavaScript function directly from the UI thread can cause issues.**

### NB - GestureDetector grasps touch event throughout
In react-native-gesture-handler, the gestures are detected based on the hierarchy and components you wrap with the GestureDetector. When using components like the camera (e.g., react-native-camera or react-native-vision-camera), the gesture handler interacts with its entire view or surface, even if there are intermediate components between the camera and GestureDetector. GestureDetector handles the gestures in its view regardless of the content between the GestureDetector and the camera component.
