The difference in how the two libraries handle images stems from their design and intended use cases:

1. **SketchCanvas**:
   - This library is designed to handle drawing and sketching on a canvas.
   - It can directly take an object with a filename path and **interpret the base64 image because it is built to handle various image sources and formats internally**.
   - It likely has built-in functionality to read and convert image files to base64 format, making it easier for developers to use different image sources without additional processing.

2. **SignatureCanvas**:
   - This library is primarily designed for capturing signatures.
   - It **does not have built-in functionality to read image files and convert them to base64 format**.
   - Therefore, you need to use an external library like react-native-fs to read the image file and convert it to a base64 string before passing it to SignatureCanvas.

NB what tag to use once you have a base64Image with SignatureCanvas:
- webStyle: Allows you to inject CSS directly into the web view, which can handle base64-encoded images.
- bgSrc: Expects a URL or a local file path, not a base64-encoded string.

In summary, the difference is due to the specific functionalities and use cases each library is designed to handle. SketchCanvas is more versatile in handling various image sources, while SignatureCanvas focuses on capturing signatures and requires external handling for image files.


Inn the react-native-signature-canvas library, **the return type of the signature is a Base64-encoded** string representing the image of the signature. This string typically starts with the prefix **data:image/png;base64**, followed by the Base64-encoded image data.
