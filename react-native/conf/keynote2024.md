The new Architercure deals with the slow JSON bridge between native layer and JS layer by establishing a **shared memory layer** link that virtually synchronises the two for a seamless experience.

- android //gradle.properties newArchEnabled=true
- ios RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 bundle exec pod install
