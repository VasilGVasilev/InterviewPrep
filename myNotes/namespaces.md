In Python, when you define variables, functions, or classes within a module, they are automatically assigned to the module's namespace. That means Python has a mechanism via its special namespace policy for modules, to isolate names and avoid global clashes. Javascript does not have native support for namespaces isolation, but this is achievable via block scoping. You can have two modules in JS as it is with Python. They will not have separate special namespaces dedicated to them, but if you export a function in both of those modules in JS and declare objects inside those functions, you achieve isolation and can have the same name for those object inside each function.
