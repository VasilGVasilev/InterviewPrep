In Python, when you define variables, functions, or classes within a module, they are automatically assigned to the module's namespace. That means Python has a mechanism via its special namespace policy for modules, to isolate names and avoid global clashes. Javascript does not have native support for namespaces isolation, but this is achievable via block scoping. You can have two modules in JS as it is with Python. They will not have separate special namespaces dedicated to them, but if you export a function in both of those modules in JS and declare objects inside those functions, you achieve isolation and can have the same name for those object inside each function.

```sh
for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // global scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // block scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}
```

The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

Explanation: Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the var keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is 4 4 4 4.

Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the let keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is 0 1 2 3.


Now, here's the crucial part: When each setTimeout callback is executed, it captures the reference to the variable i. Since there's only one i variable shared among all the callbacks, they all capture the same variable, which has a final value of 4.

This is why you see the output "4 4 4 4" when using var. All the setTimeout callbacks reference the same i, and they all log its final value.

In contrast, when you use let to declare the loop variable, each iteration of the loop creates a new block-scoped variable i. Each setTimeout callback captures the value of its own block-scoped i, leading to the expected behavior of "0 1 2 3" because each i is unique to its iteration.

VERY CRUCIAL for ASYNC Requests:

Block scoping creates a context of its own reference points to which the async requests are connected. Thus, above we have a for loop with 4 seperate blocks for each iteration and for each of those blocks we have a different value of i, but in fact the reference to the memory in heap to that instance of i is also different (although all named the same - i). So each block triggers its own callback and when the loop is finished executing, we have the resolution of each of those callbacks 0123. 

BUT, as it is in the case of global scope, in the case of block scope, the for loop finishes execution first and only then the callback returns are printed. 

```sh
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    console.log('for loop iteration', i)
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('block scope return of callback value', i); // Each callback captures its own block-scoped `i`
    });
  }
# LOGS:
# for loop iteration 0
# for loop iteration 1
# for loop iteration 2
# for loop iteration 3
# block scope return of callback value 0
# block scope return of callback value 1
# block scope return of callback value 2
# block scope return of callback value 3
```
