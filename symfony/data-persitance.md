Symfony does not have a state feature like React, since it is a server side rendering framework. We can create a service class with getters and setters, but it is vital to also include SessionStorage API in it, to make the persistance inbetween each req/res cycles, otherwise, the class we instantiate on each controller method we pass in, will merely be of use for that specific one request/response cycle.
