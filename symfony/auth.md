Authentication and Authorization in Symfony happens via set of tools explained in the [Security](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html) docs and hashed [Password](https://symfony.com/doc/5.x/security/passwords.html). It is very opinioned to the point that even there is a restricted route system called *firewall* that redirects to login if restricted route (listed in *access_control* below *firewall*) is tried to be accessed.
